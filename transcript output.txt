I want to talk about tariffs and specifically recently President Trump has decided that he wants to see a peace deal Russia Ukraine within 50 days and he's basically said if that deal isn't reached in 50 days 100% secondary tariff on Russia. What do you think about that? I love it. I mean this is this is the way President Trump operates and that's why I admire him so very much. He's a winner. uh he knows how to negotiate sanctions against Russia. Biden tried that. Hey uh they rose above that and had no problems. I mean Russia basically is financing that war against Ukraine with their oil and gas money. If that's the forceful hand we need to do to to put pressure on on the Russians to get to the negotiating table with Ukraine, then I support the president in that. You know, we we've been in this war for a long time. We've been supporting the Ukrainians. And I I think the question is what does victory look like for the United States? What is the path to peace? How do we end this war? We shouldn't call them tariffs because that sounds like this big evil word. A tariff is a sales tax on foreign goods. And Americans generally believe in sales taxes. I think every state has them. And all it is is saying we're going to charge a higher sales tax on a good from another country. Frankly, for the first hundred and some odd years of our country, it was sales taxes on foreign goods that largely funded the country.

How does a young man who was in his late teens when he founded Turning Point USA become the unlikely architect of a spiritual uprising? Our Amy Dellora explains how the faith of Charlie Kirk fueled a movement. Jesus saved my life. I'm a sinner. Gave my life to Christ. Most important decision I ever made. I believe the Bible is true and real. Why is that? Well, I could give you the technical answer. There's never been an archaeological discovery that has contradicted the truth of the Bible. And then of course the wisdom. There is not a truth of the Bible that if you apply to your life, your life does not improve dramatically.

And this week's issue, we talk about left-wing political violence. When Vice President JD Vance reacted to the assassination of his friend, the conservative political activist Charlie Kirk, he blamed a clear culprit, a culture of violence on corners of the American left. The idea that left-wing violence and right-wing wing violence in 2025 in America are equal, it's preposterous. That is not a both sides problem. My friend is dead because of left-wing

Colorado's ban on conversion therapy is now before the Supreme Court, raising First Amendment concerns. The case, Child versus Salazar, centers on whether the law violates free speech. The law aims to prevent therapists from dissuading children from gender transitions. Counselor Kaye Childs argues the law restricts her ability to counsel clients. Alliance Defending Freedom representing Child says the law dictates what counselors can discuss. They say families should have options when dealing with gender dysphoria.

The B2's iconic flying wing design isn't just for dodging radar. Those wings are giant fuel tanks capable of holding tens of thousands of gallons of jet fuel. We're talking roughly 160,000 lb of fuel. Enough to keep it airborne for over 6,000 m without stopping for a refill. But since this mission was longer than that, and since each was loaded with two 30,000 lb bombs, they did need refuels. Six of them to be precise. >> It's very easy to fly.

And Madame President, Mr. Secretary General, First Lady of the United States, distinguished delegates, ambassadors, and world leaders. Six years have passed since I last stood in this grand hall and addressed a world that was prosperous and at peace in my first term. Since that day, the guns of war have shattered the peace I forged on two continents. An era of calm and stability gave way to one of the great crisises of our time. And here in the United States, four years of weakness, lawlessness, and radicalism under the last administration delivered our nation into a repeated set of disasters. One year ago, our country was in deep trouble. But today, just eight months into my administration, we are the hottest country anywhere in the world. And there is no other country even close. America is blessed with the strongest economy, the strongest borders, the strongest military, the strongest friendships, and the strongest spirit of any nation on the face of the earth. This is indeed the golden age of America.

Our old friend Kamala Harris just came out with a political memoir about her 107 day long presidential campaign. In it, she discusses her decision not to choose former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg as her running mate because she thought that the American people were too bigoted to accept a black woman presidential candidate and a gay vice presidential candidate on the same ticket. Instead, you'll remember she settled on Tim Walls as her running mate. This is rich from the party that constantly argues that minorities, including she's, gays, and they deserve to be platformed based on the simple fact that they are minorities.
